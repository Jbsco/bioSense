A Spring 2023 project created to assist in ongoing research regarding involuntary breathing movements as exhibited by freedivers performing extended breath holds.

The project was completed and presented at Colorado Mesa University's Spring 2023 Student Showcase and was winner of the Track 4D Design category.

Initially an independent project, the program code was modified and refactored at multiple stages throughout the semester. Hardware functionality was also extended similarly.

See `codeSummary.md` for technical details in the programming of this device.
